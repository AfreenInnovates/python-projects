• Created a Python GUI project for an image slider with the help of freeCodeCamp. 

• I enhanced code efficiency and readability. 

• I added a new feature that lets the pictures play automatically like a slideshow.

• Added real-time dynamic button state management.

• Article explaining the project (published in Young Scientists Journal): https://www.youngscientistsjournal.com/post/building-a-simple-image-viewer-with-tkinter-and-pillow-in
